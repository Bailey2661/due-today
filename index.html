<!--Create a website and or responsive web application for a real or imaginary conference, webinar,
product launch, etc.

This is another easy project that you can experiment with! It will involve creating a static page
displaying the details of an event (conference, webinar, product launch, etc.). You will need both
HTML and CSS for this project.
The layout of the event page will be simple. The header section will contain the names and
images of the different speakers with links, the event venue, and the schedule. You must also
include a section that describes the purpose of the event â€“ what the event is for and which
category of audience it aims to target. Section the page into smaller chunks to make it look neat.
Choose the right font style, font color, and background color for individual sections on the page.
Also, make sure to add a registration button so that interested people can register for the event.
